Aim:
-----
We are going to demo 

To deploy the jhipster application using kubernetes on local machine using kubectl and minikube.

Pre-requisites
--------------
1. kubectl should be installed . I have installed docker dekstop , and enabled kubernetes from there itself. [Done]
2. Application JDL file for creating gateway , uaa , microservices and import this using "jhipster import-jdl app.jdl" command. [Done]
    By this time i have already imported jdl files

3. After importing I have created two end points in two services that is /ping api in appone and apptwo both. [Done]
4. Check for kubectl version, docker images and kubectl pods. On docker hub I do not have any images till now.


Steps 
----

1. Create images for every appication like appone , aaptwo , gateway , uaa using command "./mvnw package -Pdev -DskipTests jib:dockerBuild" [done]
2. After creating images verify it using "docker images" [Done]
3. Run "jhipster kubernetes" to create a deployment file [Done]
4. Run all below command after successful completion of point 4. [Done]
    docker image tag appone sumansaurabh/appone
    docker push sumansaurabh/appone
    docker image tag apptwo sumansaurabh/apptwo
    docker push sumansaurabh/apptwo
    docker image tag gateway sumansaurabh/gateway
    docker push sumansaurabh/gateway
    docker image tag uaa sumansaurabh/uaa
    docker push sumansaurabh/uaa

5. Verify this on docker hub. Lets check it via browser or kitematic [Done]

6. By this time jhipster has already generated the kubectl-apply.sh file. Run below generated command by Jhipster
    bash kubectl-apply.sh 
7. We should wait for all the pods to be up.
8 . I will expose registry as service.
9. lets invoke the api.


-------------------------------------
7. Run "minikube dashboard" 
8. kubectl delete deployment --all
kubectl delete statefulsets <statefulset-name>
